Here's my Python module for data science, that you might find useful. It provides missing values hadling, data scaling and advanced renaming along two axis (columns and indices). Requires pandas and NumPy for appropriate functionality. Currently raw product in pre-alpha version. Feel free to use and commit to your own branches!
